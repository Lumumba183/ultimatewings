              There is a special kind of joy that lights up a child's face when they receive a meal they have only heard about in stories. At Ultimate Wings Kenya, we see that joy every day. Right now, <strong className="text-deep-forest">63 children</strong> are in school because someone — somewhere — decided that a child's dream is worth fighting for.

              Behind every one of those 63 children is a story. Some are orphans. Some come from families where a single meal a day is a luxury. Some have never owned a pair of shoes. But they all share one thing: an unshakable belief that education is their way out.

              <p className="text-off-black/80 italic leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
                In every child a dream takes flight,
                A spark of hope, a beacon bright.
                Through fields of struggle, gardens of care,
                We plant the seeds of futures rare.

                Little angels, heads held high,
                With books in hand, they reach the sky.
                A meal, a smile, a school uniform —
                These simple gifts weather every storm.

                From Watamu's shores to Nairobi's streets,
                Where poverty and promise meet,
                We stand as wings beneath their soar,
                Opening windows, breaking down doors.

                Sixty-three dreams and counting still,
                Each one a promise, each one a will.
                To learn, to grow, to rise above —
                That's the power of unconditional love.

                Seeds of tomorrow, sown today,
                In classrooms where the hopeful play.
                Ultimate Wings — our vow, our creed:
                Every child deserves the chance to succeed.
