              On <strong>Ultimate Wings Kenya Day 2026</strong>, we gathered communities, leaders, students, and partners to celebrate something extraordinary: the power of educating girls. Because when you educate a girl, you don't just change her life. You change her family. Her community. Her country's economy. You change <em>everything</em>.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-display font-bold text-2xl text-deep-forest mt-10 mb-4">The Data Is Clear</h2>
            <p className="text-off-black/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The research is overwhelming and consistent. Educated girls:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-off-black/80 mb-6 ml-4">
              <li>Earn <strong>10-20% more</strong> for every additional year of schooling</li>
              <li>Marry <strong>later</strong> and have <strong>fewer, healthier children</strong></li>
              <li>Invest <strong>90% of their income</strong> back into their families and communities</li>
              <li>Are more likely to vaccinate their children and seek healthcare</li>
              <li>Become advocates for education within their communities</li>
              <li>Are more resilient to economic shocks and climate change</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-off-black/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The World Bank estimates that limited educational opportunities for girls cost countries <strong className="text-deep-forest">$15-30 trillion</strong> in lost lifetime productivity and earnings. This is not just a moral issue — it is an economic one.

            <p className="text-off-black/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              At this year's event, we heard from girls who have been with us since primary school. Girls who are now in university. Girls who are becoming doctors, teachers, and engineers. Their stories are our proof of concept. Their success is our mission fulfilled.
