              Before the sun rises over the Kenyan coast, Mama Aisha is already in her garden. Her hands move with practiced rhythm — planting, watering, tending. Five years ago, she was a widow with no income, no land, and no hope. Today, she leads a group of 15 widows who produce enough vegetables to feed their families and sell at market. This is the power of transformation.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-display font-bold text-2xl text-deep-forest mt-10 mb-4">The Widow's Burden</h2>
            <p className="text-off-black/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              In many Kenyan communities, losing a husband doesn't just mean losing a partner — it often means losing everything. Property rights are precarious. Social standing evaporates. Children need to be fed, clothed, and educated. And society looks the other way.
            </p>
            <p className="text-off-black/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Ultimate Wings Kenya looked directly at this problem and said: <em>not on our watch.</em> Today, <strong className="text-deep-forest">over 100 widows</strong> are organized into empowerment groups, building sustainable livelihoods and reclaiming their dignity.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-display font-bold text-2xl text-deep-forest mt-10 mb-4">Agriculture: The Foundation of Independence</h2>
            <p className="text-off-black/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Our agriculture program is not charity — it is a hand up. We provide:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-off-black/80 mb-6 ml-4">
              <li><strong>Chickens</strong> — for eggs and meat, creating immediate protein sources and income</li>
              <li><strong>Goats</strong> — hardy animals that provide milk, meat, and offspring to sell</li>
              <li><strong>Vegetable seeds</strong> — tomatoes, kale, spinach, and indigenous greens</li>
              <li><strong>Fruit trees</strong> — orange, mango, and cashew nut seedlings for long-term harvests</li>
              <li><strong>Beekeeping equipment</strong> — honey production for local and regional markets</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-golden-hour bg-golden-hour/5 rounded-r-xl p-6 my-8 italic text-deep-forest">
              "Fields of promise, gardens of green,<br />
              Where once was barren, life is seen.<br />
              Bees hum softly, honey flows sweet,<br />
              From hardship's shadow, hope takes its seat."
            </blockquote>

            <h2 className="font-display font-bold text-2xl text-deep-forest mt-10 mb-4">Table Banking: Community Finance</h2>
            <p className="text-off-black/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Beyond agriculture, our widows participate in <strong>table banking</strong> — a community-driven microfinance system where members contribute regularly and take turns accessing pooled funds. No banks. No interest rates. Just women supporting women.
            </p>
            <p className="text-off-black/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This system has funded small businesses, paid school fees, covered medical emergencies, and — most importantly — built a sisterhood of mutual support that no economic downturn can break.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-display font-bold text-2xl text-deep-forest mt-10 mb-4">The Transformation Story</h2>
            <p className="text-off-black/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Meet Margaret. When her husband passed, she had three children under 12 and no source of income. She joined our widow's group in 2021. We provided her with 5 chickens and vegetable seeds. Today, she has 45 chickens, a thriving vegetable garden, and two beehives. Her eldest daughter is in secondary school. Her youngest is healthy and happy.
            </p>
            <p className="text-off-black/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Margaret's story is not unique. It is replicated 100 times over — each one a testament to what happens when you invest in women.
            </p>

              <h3 className="font-display font-bold text-xl text-cream-white mb-3">Support the Agriculture Program</h3>
              <p className="text-cream-white/80 mb-6">
                A donation of KSh 5,000 ($40 USD) provides a starter kit for one widow: chickens, seeds, and training. Your investment multiplies as she grows her farm and lifts her family.

            <p className="text-off-black/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              From hardship to harvest. From despair to dignity. That is the journey of every widow in our program. And it is a journey that you can be part of.
